## Shifting Through Job Reqs

- If you're interested in AI only, you need to make sure that the job reqs
  are related to what you want.
- Decide if you want to work for a large corporation.
  - They're harder to get into
  - There's more structure to the job spec
  - Dive more into specification
    - Such as anomaly detection
  - Lots of networking / resources
  - Looks good on a resume
- Decide if you want to work for a smaller corporation.
  - Less competition to get into
  - Open-ended projects
    - More of a say in the projects and the end-design
  - Broad specification
    - You may have to do much of the work and mix together different skills,
      such as software engineering and machine learning engineer.
  - Mix between AI / Needed ToDos

  - Great for initial experience

# Intro to Machine Learning

## ML Learning Types

### Supervised Learning

Given a set of independent variables which helps us analyze the dependent
variable and the relation between them.

![](assets/supervised_learning.png)

- It learns from previous experiences _(raw data)_.
- The most popular machine learning type.
- Linear regression & support vector machines are examples of supervised 
  learning.

### Unsupervised Learning

![](assets/unsupervised_learning.png)

- A collection of variables that we try to find out the similarity between them.
- We're really looking for patterns between certain groupings in large data.
  - An example is user preferences in Spotify used as input data, trying to find
    a connection between song genres that they may like.
- Patterns are not being learned from input data, patterns are being identified
  between groups of data.

### Reinforcement Learning

The machine performs actions and looks at the results. Based on the results, it
learns then repeats until it understands.

![](assets/reinforcement_learning.png)

- The **agent** is like a video game character with a list of possible actions
  that it can take, and knows the state of the environment that it's in.
  - We give a strategy _(called a **policy**)_ where we want it to learn, 
    based on experience, how to go about beating the game. We provide the risks
    and rewards, and then it comes up with a  way to beat the game.

### Learning Optimization

- **Under-fitting**
  - Not accurate enough model to be useful in problem statement
- **Over-fitting**
  - Takes too long to process to be useful in real world scenarios
  - There are mistakes in the real world, and this function doesn't accommodate
    for that.

![](assets/fitting_graphs.png)

## Measuring Classification

Accuracy is not the only way to determine if the model is accurate

- _Example: Terrorists identified on flights_
  - 99% of the time you may detect it, but that 1% is very dangerous.

* **Recall:** Expresses ability to find all relevant instances in dataset 
* **Precision:** Proportion of the data our model says was relevant that were
actually relevant.

![](assets/classification_001.png)

![](assets/classification_002.png)

## Linear Regression

- Supervised Learning
- Finds a linear function that attempts to predict the dependent variable as a
  function of the independent variable.

![](assets/linear_regression.png)


## K-Nearest Neighbors

- Supervised Learning
- KNN is a model that classifies data points based on the points that are most
  similar to it. 
- It uses training data to make an _educated guess_ on what an unclassified 
  point should be classified as.
- Can be used for:
  - Detecting cancer in pictures
  - The price of a car coming into a lot
  - Etc.

![](assets/k_nearest_neighbor.png)

## K-Means Clustering

- Unsupervised Learning
- Group data into classifications based on no prior labeling, just the
  similarity.
- Can be used for:
  - Song recommendations
  - Determining if an email is spam
  - Etc.

![](assets/k_means_clustering.png)

## Na&Iuml;ve Bayes

- Supervised Learning
- Classification technique that assumes that a particular feature is independent
  to the presence of any other feature.
- Mostly used for:
  - Text data
  - Spam filtering
  - Etc.

The players will play is the weather is sunny. Is this correct?

![](assets/naive_bayes.png)

## Support Vector Machines

- Supervised Learning
- Classification technique that creates a decision boundary to separate 
  different classes and maximize the margin.

![](assets/support_vector_machine.png)

## Decision Trees

- Supervised Learning
- Regression/Classification technique that is essentially a combination of
  if-else statements.

![](assets/decision_tree.png)

## Markov Decision Process

- Reinforcement Learning
- Planning technique that follows the **Markov Property**.
- **Markov Property:** The future is independent of the past given the 
  present.

![](assets/markov_decision_process.png)

- An idea of how a robot could make decisions
- Each **P** Is a probability that it will do that action.

## Logistic Regression

- Supervised Learning
- Classifies between observations to a discrete set of classes.
  - **0** or **1**

![](assets/logistic_regression.PNG)

- Used often with probabilities

## Neural Networks

- Supervised Learning
- Modeled after the human brain to be a universal function approximator.

![](assets/neural_network.gif)

- Deep learning can abstract statistical learning in machine learning, making it
  universal.

## Overview of K-Means Clustering

> <https://towardsdatascience.com/k-means-clustering-for-beginners-ea2256154109>

- K-Means Clustering is considered an unsupervised learning algorithm. 
- Unlike previous algorithms where we gave the program labeled data, an
  unsupervised algorithm does not need labels. 
  - This means that the algorithm must discover the hidden patterns in the data 
    on its own. 
- Clustering means we want to take a dataset with several data points and assign
  them to a group with similar datapoints. 
  - An example is of that is below where data points are clustered into three 
    different groups.

![](assets/k_means_clustering.png)

- One practical example would be to cluster crime localities to automate insight 
  into crime-prone areas.

**There are two assumptions behind K-Means:**

1. The center of each cluster is the mean of all the data points that belong
   to the cluster.
2. Each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest center point.

The steps of the algorithm are as follows:

1. Initialize a cluster by randomly picking points from the dataset and using
   these as starting values.
2. Assign each point to the nearest cluster.
3. Compute the mean of each cluster as the mean for all points that belong to 
   it.
4. Repeat steps **2** and **3** until no point changes cluster.

## Understanding The Model

> <https://medium.com/@Nivitus./iris-flower-classification-machine-learning-d4e337140fa4>

The photo below shows the different classes of iris flower:

- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

The photo also indicates the difference between a petal and a sepal on these
flowers:


![](assets/iris.png)

The researchers who gathered this dataset went and measured the following for
the flowers:

1. Sepal length in cm
2. Sepal widih in cm
3. Petal length in cm
4. Petal widih in cm
5. The class: Iris Setosa, Iis Versicolour, Isis Virginica

Going to **Import Data &rarr; Visualize** will show the columns are set in
the same way.

### K-Means Clustering

There are three centroids. A **centroid** is what is considered the middle of
the cluster.

- So assigning 3 centroids means assigning 3 clusters.

![](assets/k_means_graph_002.png)

- The three clusters are:
  - Setosa
  - Versicolor
  - Virginica

## Evaluating The Model

- Go to **Assign Data to Clusters &rarr; Visualize** to see the graph.
  - The graph is only 2-Dimensions (X and Y) of the dataset given and the
    clusters formed, so it is harder to read.
  - Each column (4 in total) is considered a dimension for this dataset.
  - This functionality is useful in 2-D cases and gives a visual there were
    three separate clusters made.
- Looking at the **Visualization** of either **Select Columns in Dataset**,
  you can see the assignments and labels in an easier to read format.
