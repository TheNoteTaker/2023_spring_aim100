# Module 1 Notes For AIM 100

# What is AI

A computer system doing things that normally would require human intelligence.

# Types of AI

1. **Artificial Narrow Intelligence**
   - AI that simulates human intelligence at <u>one thing</u>
   - **Example:** When your camera can recognize you're in the camera frame and
     blur the background.
2. **Artificial General Intelligence**
   - AI that simulates human intelligence at <u>everything</u>
   - _Much less developed. Think Terminator and human-robots._

## Wolf Example

```java
wolf_classifier() {
    // Does it have two ears?
    // Does it have wiskers?
    // Does it have four legs?
    // Does it have a grey pelt?
}
```

- Classifier depicts one thing from another.
- If all the values are true, it's classified as a "wolf".

The issue with this classifier is that it will not be able to differentiate
between a wolf and a dog that looks like a wolf.![img.png](img.png)


- The way to get around this is **Supervised Learning**.
